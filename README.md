# Week 2 - Object-Oriented Programming in Java

Welcome to the repository for **Week 2** of our Java learning journey. This week focuses on the core principles of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Java — a critical step in building modular, maintainable, and scalable applications.

##  Overview

In **Week 2**, we explore the fundamental concepts of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Java. These principles form the backbone of real-world Java development, enabling developers to write clean, reusable, and modular code. This week provides **hands-on exposure** to designing and implementing object-oriented systems using:

- Classes
- Constructors
- Access modifiers
- object modeling
- Inheritance
- Encapsulation

##  Topics Covered

###  Day 1: Classes and Objects

- Understanding classes and objects in Java  
- Declaring and defining class members (variables and methods)  
- Creating objects using the `new` keyword  
- Instance variables and method invocation  
- Basic memory concepts associated with object creation  

---

###  Day 2: Constructors and `this` Keyword

- Defining constructors and their purpose  
- Constructor overloading  
- Using the `this` keyword to reference instance variables  
- Calling one constructor from another using `this()`  

---

###  Day 3: Access modifiers, Static and Final keywords

- Java access modifiers: `public`, `private`, `protected`, and default  
- Static variables and methods  
- Final variables, methods, and classes  
- Use cases for `static` and `final` in application design 

---

###  Day 4: Object modeling

- Identifying real-world entities as classes and objects
- Defining class attributes (fields) and behaviors (methods)
- Establishing relationships between objects (association, aggregation, composition)
- Designing modular, reusable, and maintainable object-oriented systems

---

###  Day 5: Inheritance

- Concept of inheritance and code reuse  
- Using the `extends` keyword  
- Single inheritance in Java  
- Accessing superclass members  
- The `super` keyword for constructor and method access  

---

###  Day 6: Encapsulation

- Wrapping data (variables) and methods into a single unit (class)
- Using access modifiers to restrict direct access to class members
- Providing controlled access through getter and setter methods
- Promoting data hiding and maintaining integrity of the object’s state

---

##  Prerequisites

Before beginning Week 2, ensure the following:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) is installed and configured  
- Familiarity with Java basics covered in **Week 1 – Core Java Programming**  
- A suitable IDE such as **IntelliJ IDEA**, **Eclipse**, or **Visual Studio Code**

##  How to Use This Repository

This repository is organized into folders corresponding to each day's topic. Each folder contains Java source files that illustrate the concepts discussed on that day.

To make the most of this repository:

1. Browse the daily folders to review code samples and examples  
2. Run and debug the Java files to observe behavior  
3. Modify the code to reinforce your understanding and test different scenarios  

This structure is designed to facilitate **hands-on practice** and reinforce key **OOP concepts**.
